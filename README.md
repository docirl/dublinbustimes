# dublinbustimes

This is a small script that scrapes realtime bus times for Dublin Bus (taken from rtpi.ie)

A stop number is needed for the request, and the response is parsed to show the data in consumable format to display in other apps.

My use for this is was to create Siri Shortcut for Dublin bus, and this got me start so might be useful for other applications.

(At the time the public api for Dublin Bus times was not working (from dublinked.ie) so made my own)
